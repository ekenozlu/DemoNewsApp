e# DemoApp News App
In this demo app I created a News application on Swift with Storyboard.

## App Contains:
1. Popular news from United States
2. Collection of category buttons (which I am not really proud of design :(. but it works)
3. Read articles from built-in Safari VC
4. Search screen for every news around world

## In this demo app I used and practiced:
1. API Handling
  * URLSessions
  * DispatchQueue
3. UIKit and Storyboard
  * UITableView
  * UICollectionView
  * UINavigationBar
  * UITabBar
4. Navigation Controller
  * Bar Item and Title
  * Search Bar
